### My thoughts on Kotlin
I've been really enjoying learning Kotlin, but I almost
wish that I had learned kotlin before learning swift. 
When you create a basic swift project, it looks nice 
and styled a little with iOS basic styling. With Kotlin,
the basic project is very unstyled. This is what I was 
expecting when I started app development. I wasn't
expecting that Swift would do so much for you (but I do
really enjoy it). Because swift does so much for you and
makes things easer (like navigation), I think learning
Kotlin first and understanding how to do things the longer
way would have been a better first step for me.

On the whole, I enjoy kotlin and it definetely makes some
things easier in swift. After comming from Swift's excellent
animations, I do cringe at the basic Kotlin animations, but
that means I need to learn some more Kotlin animation stuff
:)
